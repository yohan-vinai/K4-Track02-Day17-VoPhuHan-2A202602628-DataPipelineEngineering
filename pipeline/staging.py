"""Staging — typed views over Bronze. No business logic, no dedup, no deletes applied.

Reading Debezium correctly is half of CDC work. One Kafka record per change:

    key   = {"ticket_id": ...}
    value = {"before": {...} | null,   # row before the change (null for c / r)
             "after":  {...} | null,   # row after the change  (null for d)
             "source": {"lsn": ..., "ts_ms": ...},
             "op": "c" | "u" | "d" | "r"}

After a delete Debezium also sends a *tombstone*: same key, value = null, so
Kafka log compaction can forget the key. Tombstones carry no change.

Timestamps in `after` use Debezium's default for Postgres TIMESTAMP:
microseconds since epoch (io.debezium.time.MicroTimestamp).
